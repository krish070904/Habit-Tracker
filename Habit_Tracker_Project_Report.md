# HABIT TRACKER APPLICATION
## Mobile Application Development Project Report

### 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Project Name:** Habit Tracker  
**Platform:** Android  
**Programming Language:** Kotlin  
**Development Environment:** Android Studio  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Minimum SDK:** 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop)  
**Target SDK:** 34 (Android 14)  

### 2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Habit Tracker is a mobile application designed to help users create and track their daily habits. The application allows users to define habits they want to develop, and the system automatically generates daily tasks based on these habits. Users can mark tasks as completed, skipped, or failed, and the application tracks their progress over time with various statistics and visualizations.

The application is designed with a clean, modern user interface that follows Material Design principles, providing an intuitive and engaging user experience. It operates completely offline, respecting user privacy, and is ad-free.

### 3. OBJECTIVES AND GOALS
- Create a user-friendly application for tracking personal habits
- Implement an automatic task generation system for habit tracking
- Provide meaningful statistics to help users understand their progress
- Deliver a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface
- Ensure data persistence for long-term habit tracking
- Implement notifications to remind users of their daily tasks
- Allow customization of habits with various parameters

### 4. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

#### 4.1 Core Features
- **Habit Management:** Create, edit, and delete habits with customizable parameters
- **Task Generation:** Automatic generation of daily tasks based on habit configurations
- **Task Completion:** Mark tasks as completed, skipped, or failed
- **Progress Tracking:** View streak counts and completion rates for habits
- **Statistics:** Visualize habit performance with charts and graphs
- **Task History:** Review past task completion records
- **Theme Support:** Light and dark theme options for user preference

#### 4.2 User Flows
- **Creating a Habit:** User defines name, frequency, start date, and other parameters
- **Daily Task Management:** User views and updates status of daily tasks
- **Statistics Review:** User analyzes habit performance through various metrics
- **Settings Management:** User configures application preferences

### 5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

#### 5.1 Architecture
The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, providing clean separation of concerns:
- **Model:** Data classes and Room database implementation
- **View:** Activities, Fragments, and XML layouts
- **ViewModel:** Business logic and data transformations

#### 5.2 Key Technologies and Libraries
- **Android Jetpack Components:**
  - Room: For local database storage
  - ViewModel and LiveData: For reactive UI updates
  - Navigation Component: For fragment navigation
  - ViewBinding: For type-safe view access
- **Joda Time:** For date/time handling
- **Kotlin Coroutines:** For asynchronous operations
- **Material Components:** For UI implementation

#### 5.3 Database Design
The application uses Room database with the following main entities:
- **Habit:** Stores habit definitions and parameters
- **Task:** Represents daily tasks generated for habits
- **TaskLog:** Records history of task completions

#### 5.4 UI/UX Design
- Follows Material Design guidelines
- Implements a bottom navigation bar for main sections
- Uses cards for displaying habits and tasks
- Features custom charts for statistics visualization
- Supports both light and dark themes
- Provides intuitive form inputs for habit creation

### 6. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

3. **Core Implementation:** Developed habit and task management
4. **UI Development:** Created responsive and attractive interface
5. **Statistics Implementation:** Added data visualization features
6. **Testing and Refinement:** Identified and resolved issues

#### 6.3 Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Efficient task generation for recurring habits
  **Solution:** Implemented a background service for daily task creation
  
- **Challenge:** Providing meaningful statistics
  **Solution:** Developed custom chart views and aggregation algorithms
  
- **Challenge:** Ensuring data integrity with various user actions
  **Solution:** Implemented robust database transactions and validation

### 7. TESTING

#### 7.1 Testing Approach
